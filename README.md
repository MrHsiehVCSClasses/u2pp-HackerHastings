This program fills the purpose of providing a class for creating Meth Grams with accurate prices according to their purity. The user can interact with the terminal to request certain types of Meth Grams, and the program passes the user's parameters to the Meth Gram function to create different instances of the same Meth Gram according to what type it is.

This program also provides a class for creating Meth ingredients with names, prices, and rarities. The user can interact with the terminal to request different types of ingredients, and the program passes these requests to different functions depending on what the user requested. The prices are generated semi-randomly, according to the price bracket of the specific level of ingredients and the type of ingredient within that level so that they add to a certain percent of the average price of a gram of Meth in that level in order to give the user profit in future updates where meth production is implemented.

The user can "talk to" the terminal in order to view the different prices and names of ingredients and meth classes in the program.

The user can start the program by running it.
